# Payments Received

Any payment that you receive from a customer can be recorded and applied across their various outstanding invoices. You can also view the payments recorded for the invoices.

### View Payments Received

If you have already recorded payments from your customers, you can view them in the Payments Received module. Here’s how:

  * Go to the sidebar and click the **Payments Received** module.
  * Click on a payment receipt to view its details.

### Record New Payment

While recording a new payment from a customer, you can choose to split the amount received on their outstanding invoices either in full or in part.

**Scenario:** Patricia receives a payment of $500 from her customer, who has two outstanding invoices of value $300 and $450, respectively. Patricia can split the payment of $500 into $300 for the first invoice (full amount) and $200 for the second invoice (partial amount). So, the second invoice will still have a balance of $250 to be paid.

  * Go to the **Payments Received** module on the sidebar.
  * Click the **+New** button on the top right corner.



In the Record Payment page:

  * Select the customer from whom you’ve received the payment.
  * Enter the total amount received in the **Amount** field, or, click the **Pay full amount** checkbox to record the full outstanding payment for the customer.
  * Choose the account to which the payment should get **deposited to**.



  * Split the amount received from the customer (entered in the Amount field) among the outstanding invoices.
  * Click **Clear applied amount** to clear all the amount entered.
  * Click **Pay in Full** to auto-fill the Payment field with the entire amount due for each invoice.



  * You can view the amount used for payments and the available balance (amount in excess) in the **Total** section.

    * **Amount Received:** Total amount received from the customer.
    * **Amount used for payments:** Amount applied on the invoices.
    * **Amount in excess:** Any excess payment by the customer, i.e. the amount that is not applied on the invoices.
  * Add notes and attach files for the payment. You can also send a thank you note to the customer for the payment.

  * Click **Save** at the bottom of the page.




* * *

### Edit Payment

You can edit the details of any payment received. Here’s how:

  * Go to **Payments Received** on the sidebar.
  * Click the payment receipt you want to edit.
  * Click the  icon on top of the page.

  * Click **Save**.
