### Quantity Adjustment

A quantity adjustment is made when the recorded stock does not match the actual available stock in your warehouse for reasons outside the normal business such as theft, damaged goods, data entry error, write-off, donation etc. In Zoho Inventory, you’ll be able to record stock adjustments for basic inventory-tracked items as well as those which are serial and batch-tracked.

**Note:** You can only adjust stock for inventory-tracked items.

To record a quantity adjustment in Zoho Inventory:

  1. Go to the **Inventory Adjustments** module under _Inventory_ from the left sidebar.

  2. Click the **\+ New** button on the top right corner of the page.

  3. In the New Adjustment page, select **Quantity Adjustment** as your mode of adjustment.

  4. Choose the account in which you want this adjustment to be reflected. For example, you can track your loss of items due to theft, damage etc., under a separate account so that you get clear-cut information in your reports.

  5. Select a reason for making this adjustment. If your reason isn’t listed in the drop down, then you can [add or remove the reasons](/de-de/inventory/help/items/inventory-adjustments.html#manage-adjustment-reason).
