# Reporting Tags

Reporting tags are labels with different values, which can be associated with entities such as customers, vendors, items, orders, invoices, and credits in Zoho Inventory. These tags can then be used to filter reports, giving you a categorized insight into your business. 

**Scenario:** Peter runs a retail store with three branches. Each month, he would like to see the best-selling items in each branch. To do this, he creates a reporting tag with the branch names, then associates them with the items in his invoices. At the end of the month, he generates sales reports based on these reporting tags.

### Create Tags
