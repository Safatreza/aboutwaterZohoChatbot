# Vendor Portal

**Note:** This feature is available only for certain plans of Zoho Inventory. Visit the [pricing page](/inventory/pricing-comparison/) to check if it’s available in your current plan.

The Vendor Portal helps your vendors to manage purchase orders, view the payments they’ve received, upload invoices to be converted to bills in Zoho Inventory, and more! Let’s understand the use of a vendor portal with the help of a scenario.

**Scenario:** John’s business, ABC Limited, buys all the supplies they need from multiple vendors. Instead of communicating with all of them individually regarding orders, John can send invites to the vendors to access their respective vendor portals. In their portal, they can view purchase orders, submit invoices, and interact through comments with John regarding an order from one place.

### Enable Vendor Portal

To start off, you will have to enable portal access and invite your vendor or their contact persons you’ve added in Zoho Inventory. To enable the portal:

  * Go to the **Vendors** module under **Purchases** from the left sidebar.
  * Select the vendor for whom you want to enable the portal.
  * Click the **More** dropdown and select **Configure Vendor Portal**.



(Or)

  * Go to the **Overview** tab and enable portal access under the **Other Details** section.

  * Choose the contact person for whom you would like to enable portal access.




  * Click **Save** and an email invitation will be sent to your vendor and they will be able to access the portal by accepting the invitation.



You can configure the portal in the [preferences](/de-de/inventory/help/vendor-portal/#Vendor-Portal-Preferences) section.

### Accept the Invitation

Once your vendor accepts the invitation, they will be able to view and track all their transactions, upload transaction documents and collaborate with you easily. To join the portal, your vendor should:

  * Go to the email invite sent to them.
  * Click the **Accept Invitation** button and they will be redirected to the portal login page.
  * Enter the email address, set a password and sign in.



They will now be logged in to the portal where they can perform various functions.
