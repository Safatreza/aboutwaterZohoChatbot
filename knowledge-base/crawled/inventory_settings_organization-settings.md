# Organization Profile

The organization profile lets you manage the core details of your businesslike the organization name, address, industry, business type, and similar details. When you first set up your organization in Zoho Inventory, you would have entered key details such as your organization’s name, address, and industry; they will be auto-populated here. These details automatically appear on your transaction PDFs and email notifications. In this document, you’ll learn how to edit and update them.

**Prerequisite:** To make any changes to the **Organization** **Profile** , you must be the **Admin** of the organization or your custom role must have access to **Update Organization Profile** under _Settings_. 

To set up your organization profile:

  * Log in to your Zoho Inventory account.

  * Navigate to **Settings** in the top right corner

  * Click **Profile** under _Organization_ in _Organization Settings._

  * The fields are grouped into the following sections:

  * [Basic Details](/de-de/inventory/help/settings/organization-settings.html#Basic-Details)

  * [Address Details](/de-de/inventory/help/settings/organization-settings.html#Address-Details)

  * [Contact Details](/de-de/inventory/help/settings/organization-settings.html#Contact-Details)

  * [Regional Settings](/de-de/inventory/help/settings/organization-settings.html#Regional-Settings)

  * [Additional Settings](/de-de/inventory/help/settings/organization-settings.html#Additional-Settings)




**Note:** Fields marked with an asterisk (*) are mandatory.

  * Click **Save** to update your preferences.



**Insight:** If the same organization is set up in other Zoho Finance applications (such as Books, Billing, Checkout, Commerce, Expense, Invoice, Payroll, Practice, Vikra, and Zakya), any changes made to the organization profile in Zoho Inventory will automatically reflect across those apps. For instance, updating your organization address in Zoho Inventory will update it in Zoho Books as well. This ensures consistency across all applications and saves you time spent on updating manually in each app.

## Basic Details

The **Basic Details** section allows you to define your company’s primary information, including its name, logo, industry, and location.

To do this, navigate to _Settings > Organization >_ **Locations**. Select the business location for which you want to change the logo. On the following page, choose **Upload a New Logo** from the _Logo_ dropdown. Click the **Upload your Location Logo** button, select your image file, and click **Open**.

Once uploaded, the seal will automatically appear on your transaction PDFs (invoices, quotes, purchase orders, and other transactions) and the email notifications sent.

## Contact Details

You can manage your organization’s contact details, including the primary contact person and the website URL.

## Change Your Primary Contact

The **Primary Contact** displayed in the _Organization Profile_ is the email address that you had provided while signing up for Zoho Inventory. It serves two key purposes:

  * **Communication from Zoho** : You’ll receive important updates related to your Zoho Inventory subscription, usage alerts, and account-related notifications at this address.
  * **Default Sender Email** : This address is also used as the default “**From** ” field when sending quotes, invoices, and other communications to your customers or users from Zoho Inventory, unless you manually change them.



If you want to use another email address as the primary contact in Zoho Inventory, you can change it. Here’s how:

  * Navigate to **Settings** in the top right corner.
  * Click **Profile** under _Organization_ in _Organization Settings._
  * Scroll down to the Primary Contact section.
  * Click the **Gear** icon next to the _Email_ field and you’ll be redirected to the Sender Email Preferences page. Here, you can [add a new sender email address, verify it,](/de-de/inventory/help/settings/emails.html#add-new-sender) and [mark it as the primary contact](/de-de/inventory/help/settings/emails.html#mark-primary) in Zoho Inventory. Once marked, all of your transaction-related communications will be sent from this email by default.



**Warning:**

  * Using an email with an **unauthenticated domain** as your primary contact in Zoho Inventory may cause your emails to be flagged as spam. In such cases, emails will be sent on your behalf via: **[message-service@sender.zohoinventory.com](mailto:message-service@sender.zohoinventory.com).** To send emails from your primary contact’s email address, click **Authenticate Now** to verify your domain.
  * Likewise, if the email address belongs to a **public domain** (For example, Gmail, Yahoo), it will also be replaced with **[message-service@sender.zohoinventory.com](mailto:message-service@sender.zohoinventory.com)**. To continue using public domains:
    * Click **Change Settings** in the banner displayed.
    * In the following popup, select either the **Zoho Inventory Email Address** or the **Sender’s Email Address** as the preferred sender.
    * Click **Save** to update your sender preferences.



### Website URL
