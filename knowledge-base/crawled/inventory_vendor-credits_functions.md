# Functions in Vendor Credits

### Apply Credits to Bills

Vendor credits can be applied to other bills that are created for the same vendor. Doing so will reduce the bill amount accordingly. To do this:

  2. Open the vendor credit you want to apply to bills.

  3. Click the **Apply to Bills** button in the top right corner.

  4. Enter the amount to apply to each bill from the balance.

  5. Click **Save**.




Alternatively,

  1. Go to the _Bills_ module on the sidebar.
  2. Open the bill for which you want to apply credits to.
  3. Click the **Use Credits** option in the bill.
  4. Enter the amount to apply to the bill from the available credit balance.
  5. Click **Save**.



If you have used up a vendor credit completely, it is marked as _Closed_.
