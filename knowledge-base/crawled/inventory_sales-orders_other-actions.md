### Cancel items in a Sales Order

Let us consider a scenario where some of the items in a sales order have already been packed and shipped. But in the last minute your customer decides to cancel the rest. In situations like these, you can selectively cancel items and its quantity. To do so:

> **Prerequisite:** Your sales order must have some items that are not yet packed or invoiced.

  * Open a sales order of your choice.



  * Click on **More** button on the top right corner.
  * Select the **Cancel Items** option from the dropdown menu.



  * A dialogue box opens up with the items and its quantity committed for the particular Sales Order.
  * Retain the items that need to be cancelled.
  * Mention the quantity of the item to cancel under **Quantity to cancel**.
  * To proceed, click on **Proceed** button.



##### Note:

  * You cannot cancel items for which a package or invoice is created from the particular Sales Order.
  * Items cannot be cancelled from sales orders that have been marked for drop-shipment or back order.
  * If your sales order is in draft or in confirmed state without any invoice or package associated, its line items can be either edited or the sales order itself can be voided.



* * *

### Re-open Cancelled Items

To re-open the cancelled items in a sales order, follow the steps below:

  * Open a sales order with cancelled items.
  * Click on **More** button on the top right corner.
  * Select **Reopen cancelled items** option. All the items cancelled in the sales order, will become available for further transactions.

  * Click on the **Sales Orders** module on the sidebar.
  * Select all the sales orders in which you wish to cancel the items.
  * Click on **More** button and select **Bulk Cancel items** option from the dropdown menu.



  * Similarly, you can bulk re-open cancelled items in sales orders.

  * Another pop up appears to reconfirm the action as once a sales order is voided, the action cannot be reverted.
  * To proceed click **Proceed** button.
  * The status of your sales order changes to Void.



**Note:** A sales order that has been invoiced or paid(incase of marketplace orders) cannot be voided.

### View invoice details within the sales order

If you have associated invoices with a sales order, you can have a quick glance at its details from the sales order itself. To do so:

  * Go to **Sales Orders**.
  * Open a sales order with invoice associated.
  * Go to the **Comments & History** tab.
  * Click **View the Invoice** link. A tab will open from the right with the details of the invoice.

### Create Custom Views

Custom views are specific views to list your Sales Orders, based on your criteria. For example, out of all your Sales Orders in Zoho Inventory, you might want to view those sales orders which are supposed to be shipped today.

With Custom Views, you can simply create this filter, set criteria and use it to classify data.

To create a Custom View:

  * Go to the **Sales Orders** module.
  * Under the **All Sales Orders** drop down, present at the top left, select **\+ New Custom View**.
  * In the following page, give an appropriate **Name** to your view, define **Criteria, Column Preference** (i.e. columns which you want to see in the filtered results).
  * Click **Save**. Your new custom view will now be listed under **Created By Me** , in the dropdown.



* * *

### Create Custom Status

Sometimes you might want to mark some Sales Orders with a specific status, apart from the default ones present in Zoho Inventory. For example, you might have multiple Sales Orders that require backordering, but you may wish to backorder them later, instead of doing it right away. In such cases, it would be extremely convenient to assign a custom status to all those confirmed Sales Orders that require backordering. The custom status option would help you out with this.

To create a Custom Status,

  * Navigate to **Settings - > Preferences -> Sales Orders**.
  * In the _Custom Status_ section, click on **Add New Custom Status**.
  * Select a default Sales Order status from the **Custom Status For** dropdown. This will act as a parent to your custom status. You will be able to mark your Sales Order with the custom status only when it has reached its corresponding parent status. For example, if your custom status name is **“To be backordered”** and its parent status is **Confirmed** , you will be able to mark only the _Confirmed_ Sales Orders as _To be backordered_.
  * Give the **Status Name** for your custom status.
  * Click **Save**.



Now, go to any Sales Order with the status specified in the **Custom Status For** field. Click on the **More** button and you’ll have the option to mark the Sales Order with your custom status.

##### Notes

  * You can revert back to the Sales Order’s original status by clicking on the **More** button and selecting the status name.
  * If the parent status is changed, say from Draft to Confirmed, the custom status will be unmapped from the Sales Order.



#### How to filter them out?

You can create [Custom Views](/de-de/inventory/help/sales-orders/other-actions.html#custom-view) for the custom statuses that you create, and you can them filter them out accordingly. When you create a custom view, select the **Order Sub-Status** as the criteria for the view.
