# Custom Modules

There might be times when the predefined modules in Zoho Inventory may not be sufficient to manage all your business requirements. In such cases, you can create a custom module to record other data.

**Note:** This feature is available only for certain plans of Zoho Inventory. Visit the [pricing page](https://www.zoho.com/inventory/pricing/) to check if it’s available in your current plan.

Here are few scenarios to help you understand when the custom module may come in handy:

**Scenario 1:** Patricia has recently taken her business online and wants to track all the e-commerce transactions separately in her Zoho Inventory organization. To achieve this, she creates a custom module named E-com Transactions with the fields; Customer Name, E-commerce ID, Transaction Number, and Total. Now, if she wants to record or find a specific transaction, she can view them from the E-com Transactions module.

**Scenario 2:** Zylker uses Zoho Inventory to account for their daily business activities, one of which is funding other companies. The Admin wants the cashier to keep track of all the debtors activities (the companies they have funded) and send reminders to them about the due date. The admin creates a custom module - Debtors and goes to the Users and Roles section and gives access to the cashier. Now, the cashier can keep track of all the debtors and also write an automation task to send them email reminders regarding the due dates.
