# Custom Approval

Custom Approval allows organizations to create approval flows that are tailored to their unique business needs, particularly when the default approval flow might not be suitable.

**Note:** This feature is only available in Professional and higher plans. Visit our [pricing page](/inventory/pricing/) to see if this feature is available in your plan.

**Scenario:** Brandon is a Sales Manager at Zylker. Usually, he approves invoices for Zylker’s customers. However, if an invoice total is more than $10,000, Patricia, the Head of Sales, must approve it. Brandon sets up a custom approval in the Invoices module of Zoho Inventory by adding a criteria that invoices of $10,000 or more should be sent to Patricia for approval.

### Create a Custom Approval

To create a custom approval flow for a module:

  * Go to **Settings** in the top right corner of the page.
  * Navigate to the module for which you want to add a custom approval.
  * Click the **Approvals** tab.
  * Click **Custom Approval** under _Approval Type_.
  * Click **New Custom Approval**. You’ll be redirected to the New Custom Approval page.
  * Enter the **Approval Name** and provide a **Description** if required.
  * Add the criteria based on which the custom approval should be triggered. Click **\+ Add Criterion** to add more criteria.
  * Select the approval flow. You can configure an approval flow, or choose to auto accept or auto reject transactions.
  * Click **Save**.



### Prioritize an Approval

If you’ve created multiple custom approvals for a module, in some cases, transactions can fulfill the criteria of more than one custom approval. In such cases, you can prioritize which custom approval should be triggered first. Here’s how:

  * Go to **Settings** in the top right corner of the page.

  * Navigate to the module for which you want to prioritize custom approvals.

  * Click the **Approvals** tab.

  * Click **Custom Approval** under _Approval Type_.

  * Click the Edit button next to PRIORITY.

  * Drag and reorder the approvals as per priority. The approval with priority number 1 will be prioritized over the other approvals.

  * Click **Save Priority Changes**.




### Edit or Delete a Custom Approval

You can edit and delete the custom approvals if required. Here’s how:

  * Go to **Settings** in the top right corner of the page.
  * Navigate to the module for which you created the custom approval.
  * Click the **Approvals** tab.
  * Click **Custom Approval** under _Approval Type_.
  * Hover over the custom approval you want to edit or delete.
  * Click the dropdown and select **Edit** or **Delete**.
  * If you want to edit a custom approval, click **Edit**. Make the necessary changes and click **Save**.
  * If you want to delete a custom approval, click **Delete**. Click **Delete** again.
