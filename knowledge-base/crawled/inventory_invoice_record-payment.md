# Record Payments for Invoices

There are multiple ways in which you can collect and record payments in Zoho Inventory based on your business needs:

### Online Payment

Collecting payments online from your customers is one of the safest and fastest ways to get paid for your invoices. You can enable your customers to pay online by integrating Zoho Inventory with popular [payment gateways](/de-de/inventory/help/integrations/online-payments.html). Your customers will be able to pay via credit cards, debit cards, net banking, and other payment options offered by the payment gateway.

#### How Online Payments Work in Invoices

Once you set up a payment gateway integration, by default, the payment gateway will be marked as the mode of payment in the invoice under the online payments section. When you send this invoice to your customer, they will be able to pay online using one of the available payment options.

If you have configured multiple payment gateways, you can select the payment gateway through which you want to receive payments from your customers. Here’s how:

  1. Go to the **Invoices** module under **Sales** from the left sidebar.

  2. Select the invoice for which you want to select your preferred payment gateway.

  3. Click the **Edit** button.

  4. Scroll down to the section below Terms and Conditions where you will see the list of payment gateways that you had integrated with Zoho Inventory.

  5. Select your preferred payment gateway through which you want to receive payments from your customer.

**Note:** If you select more than two payment gateways, Zoho Inventory will automatically use the payment gateway that you integrated last.

  6. Click **Save** and send it to your customer.




Now, your customer will be able to pay you from the invoice email/link you had sent them.

### Charge Customer

Another method of collecting payments from your customers is by charging your customers’ card directly for an invoice using online payment gateways. Ensure that you have chosen a payment gateway that supports charging a customer’s card.

**Note:** The payment gateways that support charging a customers card are Authorize.net, PayPal Payflow Pro, PayPal Payments Pro, Razorpay and Paytm. Ensure that you have the card details of the customer you want to charge and their consent to charge their card for the invoice.

To charge your customers:

  1. Go to the **Invoices** module under **Sales** from the left sidebar.

  2. Select the invoice for which you want to charge your customer’s card.

  3. Click the **Record Payment** dropdown button in on the invoice’s menubar and select **Charge Customer**.

  4. Enter the amount to be charged and select a payment gateway from the dropdown.

  5. Enter all the necessary details.

  6. Select the ‘Use this card for future transactions’ option if your customer prefers to pay using this card in the future.

  7. Click **Proceed**.




On a successful transaction, you will get an alert saying that the transaction has been processed and the invoice’s status changes to **Paid**.
