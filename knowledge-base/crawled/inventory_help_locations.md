# Locations

In Zoho Inventory, the Locations feature helps you categorize transactions, manage inventory, and track financial performance based on Business and Warehouse Locations.

**Note:** Locations is an upgraded version of the existing [Branches](/de-de/inventory/help/branches/) feature. To migrate to the location feature, you navigate to _Settings > Organization > **Warehouses/Branches**_. Click **Migrate to Locations** on the banner that appears at the top of the screen. You can also do this by clicking **Migrate to Locations** in the one-time banner that appears on the home screen.
