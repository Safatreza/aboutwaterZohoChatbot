# Retainer Invoices

Suppliers who take up medium to large scale orders usually collect advance payment either in good faith or to procure the materials required for the job. This amount will not be an income but a liability to them until the delivery or service is completed. If the supplier is unable to fulfil the order, or the buyer decides to back out, the amount is refunded. In Zoho Inventory, you can record advance payments as retainers and use them on invoices or refund them if the order is dropped.
